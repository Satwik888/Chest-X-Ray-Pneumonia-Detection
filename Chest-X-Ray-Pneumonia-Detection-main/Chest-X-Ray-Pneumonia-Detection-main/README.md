# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Detection-using-InceptionV3-Transfer-Learning-
This project implements a deep learning model to detect Pneumonia from chest X-ray images using Transfer Learning with InceptionV3, a convolutional neural network pre-trained on ImageNet.  The model classifies X-ray images into two categories:  NORMAL  PNEUMONIA
